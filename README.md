After the user types in a city name, that city is automatically loaded into the user's search history through local storage. Previous cities the user has searched for (or someone using the same browser and device) appear as a list of buttons, that the user can refer back to if they want to keep an eye on favorite cities. 


This app uses HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap elements), JavaScript, JQuery, and the OpenWeatherSource API, for two discinct API calls.
